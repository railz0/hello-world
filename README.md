# hello-world
Time to finally get familiar with git and start putting projects together.

Only really know Java and C, as those are languages I've worked in the most as a student so far.
I wish to expand on those and learn Python, which I have minor experience with, potentially some other script languages as well.
First project I have in mind involves learning web scraping to automate a process which is quite tiring when done manually.
Part of my plan is doing proper documentation before starting the project, just to make sure I know when to stop. Most problematic part of my own creative process has always been coming up with new stuff along the way and wanting to add it on, which made matters troublesome. Well defined goals should help that.
